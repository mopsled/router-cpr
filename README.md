# Router-CPR

## Description

A router configuration password recovery tool for Android. Uses a very simple wordlist to brute-force HTTP basic authentication.

This tool can be used to attack any HTTP basic authentication, but is designed for recovering unknown router password configurations for home networking equipment. If a user/password combination is successfully recovered, the user has the option to save the router's location and information to a local database, which can be browsed later on a map.
